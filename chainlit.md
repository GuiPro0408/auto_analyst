# 🔬 Auto-Analyst

Welcome to **Auto-Analyst**, your autonomous research assistant powered by RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).

## What I Can Do

- **Research any topic** — I search multiple sources, process documents, and synthesize information
- **Provide cited answers** — Every claim is backed by inline citations `[1]`, `[2]`, etc.
- **Follow-up conversations** — Ask clarifying questions and I'll remember context
- **Verify facts** — I cross-check generated answers against source documents

## How It Works

1. **📋 Planning** — I break down your question into targeted search queries
2. **🔍 Searching** — I search using Gemini grounding and Tavily for comprehensive coverage
3. **📄 Fetching** — I download and process relevant documents
4. **🧠 Generating** — I create a comprehensive answer with citations
5. **✅ Verifying** — I fact-check the answer against sources

## Tips for Better Results

- Be specific in your questions
- For comparisons, name the items you want compared
- For recent events, mention the timeframe
- Follow up with clarifying questions if needed

## Settings

Use the ⚙️ settings panel to adjust:

- **Number of sources** — How many documents to retrieve
- **LLM model** — The AI model for generation
- **Embedding model** — The model for semantic search
